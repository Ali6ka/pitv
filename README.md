The need for notifying students with news, announcements or advertisements should not be left without attention. Therefore I intend to provide a solution by constructing media system which has capability to monitoring news, announcements across all announcement platforms (TVs) in university. 

The project involves the use of Raspberry PIâ€™s, TV Monitors and web application.The system will display all media content downloaded by the users throughout the university or in a certain block. The content can be different, starting with a regular text message and ending with a full-fledged video file. This will enable administration quickly inform its students and also get rid of unnecessary manually posting announcements throughout the university. Students can keep abreast of all events, what is going on inside the campus.

The system was developed for the needs of university but still can be suitable for other institutions (store, hospitals, etc).

### States
According to all features, there is a list of modes and state-chart in which the system is located during the work:
  -	Media content playing mode - when there is a media content to play
  -	Schedule displaying mode - each break time
  -	Clock showing mode - when there is no media content to play
